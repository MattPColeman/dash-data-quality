# dash-data-quality
A dashboard that visualises the quality of data.

### Data quality metrics, and how to visualise:
- Error ratio (missing, redundant or incomplete data : valid data) (Measures completeness, consistency...)
- Data availability (over which date ranges/locations/whatever is data available) (Measures completeness, consistency...)
- TODO - add more...

###Â Key areas
- Completeness
- Uniqueness
- Timeliness
  - Need to measure 'lag' between time of data sourcing and data availability
- Validity
- Accuracy
- Consistency
